#dev

must take into account 0, 1-4 and 5+ respondents -> reduced info both in dash-view and specific survey-view

add description for each dimension


#Product #1

add data visuallization on web
add report-generator (I see there are heroku addons for html->pdf)

#fun stuff
add screenshots to show of products on front page
create "customers" for social-proof bar
add impact stories to front page, and possibly own page
add about us explaining scientific background of test (if any...)
about us page and link in footer
contact us page and link in footer


#external services

chat-box

SEO?
Google ads
Get someone to help get tests to work on Heorku CI (step 1 - is app.json correct)
password validation for signup
terms of use, and all that

#Stripe-redo
Add better flow -> create customer, -> create payment method, and attach -> create, change, cancel subscription -> control that U can only have one
tests for stripe views and models, and Plan and Subscriber and everything
users deciding to re-signup before their last billing period expired, should not be billed doubly.

#finishing touch
more info in edit profile AND in sign up
remake illustrations with the right color
Custom heroku error pages: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-pages#customize-pages
use standard sign-up and change-password views?
- When visiting add employees for the first time, it would be neat if user was already added
- more tests (survey response view, )
- add a consent-was-given attribute to every survey instance. check in view if it was given before the paginated pages, and make option to revoke consent.
Can we make a unique restraint on employee emails in DB?
When 3 surveys have been completed, a line chart may be a better way to present development
